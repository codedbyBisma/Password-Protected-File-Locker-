🛠️ Compilation & Execution

To compile and run the program:

nasm -f elf32 locker.asm -o locker.o

ld -m elf_1386 locker.o _o locker

./locker

🔒 How It Works

1. The program prompts the user for a password (admin by default).

2. Upon successful login, it shows a list of available text files.

3. User can select a file to read its contents (Unlock).

4. User can also lock a file (overwrite/create a new one).
